Small program to save lines of a PDF file containing specific words to .txt file

Backstory: The clerks at my work were forced to verify information monthly from 60+ page PDFs. They were manually searching for specific words line by line. I wrote this small program to extract the lines of text that contain the search word and save it to a file for them.
